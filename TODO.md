# TODO

## Coding
Write a training primer script, a testing primer script, and maybe something to mix and match the two.

Write a better run script. I'm certain there is some easy statistical gathering there.



## Setup
Should the JavaScript be pulled from a sourcejs directory, then beautified and minified for good js, then obfuscated for badjs?

Work on getting some in-the-wild obfuscated JavaScript (malicious or not).

Determine if bsfilter is good enough for this experiment. If not, prepare to swap in something Weka.

Does this work with JavaScript project code from GitHub? How about one-liners embedded in HTML files?

Figure out a better tool than wget, since it's missing a lot of script tags in HTML files.



## Experiment
Migrate from a proof-of-concept to a better experiment setup, generating artifacts, data, etc.
